# Traveling salesman

## Requirements
Pandas

Numpy

## Notes
The scripts are meant to solve the traveling salesman problem in three different ways. Namely by exhaustive search (brute force), a hillclimber algorithm, and a genetic algorithm.
The solutions can be found in exhaust.py, hill.py and geneticalgorithm.py. See code for more detailed comments.
